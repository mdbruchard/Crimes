# Crimes
 
 This project is a simple exploratory analysis of American crimes. The data set was collected at [data.gov](https://data.gov/).

 The tools I have used to do it:
 1. Python
 2. Jupyter Notebook
 3. Libraries such as Pandas and numpy for data manupulation
 4. Libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
